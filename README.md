# MealPlanV1
This project was created as a way to randomize meal plans.
It is a MVP as of 3-8-18, but not where I want it to be. I overcomplicated it when
I originally started, and plan to make a V2 with better algorithms and data structures.
This program utilizes Java's Swing elements for the user interface.

# MealPlanV2
This is my second version of MealPlanV1. Intended to make MealPlanV1 faster, and a lot less confusing in its implementation. As with MealPlanV1, I plan on using Java's Swing elements to create the application interface.

# TimeToTarget
TimeToTarget or TTT is a Android app for shooting enthusiasts. The goal of this program is to calculate the time it will take for a projectile to reach a target at a given distance, as well as the drop of the projectile over the given distance to the target. TTT will calculate these two variables for multiple calibers for both pistol and rifle rounds. TTT will take into account projectile weight, and projectile velocity.
