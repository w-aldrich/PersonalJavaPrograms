PREPARE PIE CRUST: 1. Whisk gluten-free flour, sugar, and salt in large mixing bowl to blend. 2. Add butter and mix gently on low speed or rub in with fingertips until small pea-size clumps form. Add 5 tablespoons ice water; mix lightly until dough holds together when small pieces are pressed between fingertips, adding more water by teaspoonfuls if dough is dry. 3. Gather dough together; divide into 2 pieces. Form each piece into ball, then flatten into disks and wrap in plastic. Refrigerate 30 minutes or more. 4. Roll out one dough disk on lightly floured parchment paper to 12-13-inch round. Transfer to 10-inch stoneware pie dish. Trim dough overhang to 1/2 inch. Preheat oven to 350 degrees PREPARE FILLING: 1. In a large frying pan, sauté or poach chicken breasts until cooked through. Remove from pan, cut into bite-sized pieces, and set aside. 2. Saute carrots, celery and onion in olive oil. 3. Place chicken stock in pan and bring to a boil. Add vegetables and cook for 15 minutes. 4. Add chicken and peas and cook for five minutes longer. 5. In a small bowl, whisk flour and water to make a thin paste. Thicken stock with flour paste, cook on low one to two more minutes. 6. Add sour cream cream, season as desired with salt and pepper. 7. Roll out second dough disk on lightly floured parchment paper to 12-13-inch round. Using large knife or pastry wheel with fluted edge, cut ten 3/4-inch-wide strips from dough round. 8. Transfer pie filling to dough-lined dish. Arrange dough strips atop filling, forming lattice; trim dough strip overhang to 1/2 inch. Fold bottom crust up over ends of strips and crimp edges to seal. Cover pie crust with (silicone) pie shield. Place pie on rimmed baking sheet. 9. Bake at 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes or until top is lightly browned and liquid bubbles around the edges. 10. Let cool 10 minutes. Serve warm.
