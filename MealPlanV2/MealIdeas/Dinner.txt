Title:
Coconut Chicken Curry
Ingredients:
For the paste:
1 onion, chopped
1 inch ginger, peeled and finely chopped
1 green chilli, chopped (inc seeds)
2 garlic cloves, crushed
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1.5 tsp turmeric
3 tbsp extra virgin olive oil
For the curry:
8 chicken thighs, boneless and skinless, chopped into large chunks
400ml (14 fl oz) coconut milk
½ lemon, juice only
½ small bunch coriander, roughly chopped
½ small bunch mint, roughly chopped
Recipe:
Place all the paste ingredients (except the olive oil) into a blender and blitz until combined. Add the oil and mix again. You should now have a good paste consistency (will look like a thick puree). Add in a bit more oil if needed.
Heat a large frying pan over a medium heat and add the paste. Leave the paste to cook for a few minutes and the aromas will start to release.
Add the chicken to the paste along with the lemon juice and stir until combined. Cook for around 5 minutes to seal the chicken.
Add the coconut milk and mix into the paste, bring to a simmer and leave to cook for 15-20 minutes stirring occasionally.
Remove from the heat and stir in the mint and coriander. Serve hot with cauliflower rice.

Heat 1 Tablespoon oil in wok then, once hot, add 1/2 the marinated beef in one layer. Let sit undisturbed until seared, 30 seconds, then stir fry until just barely cooked through (some pink still showing is ok.) Remove to plate with broccoli.

½ teaspoon chili powder
¼ teaspoon of ground cayenne red pepper
1/8 teaspoon cumin
1/8 teaspoon paprika
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
½ teaspoon dried oregano
½ teaspoon Sea salt
1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper
[br][b]Vegetables:[/b]
2 tablespoon organic coconut oil
1 yellow bell pepper, trimmed, de-seeded and sliced
1 red bell pepper, trimmed, de-seeded and sliced
1 yellow onion, trimmed, peeled and sliced into thin slices
1 garlic clove, minced
5 ounces shitake mushrooms</span>
2 green onions, green part sliced
1 cup vegetable broth
1 jalapeno, seeded and sliced thinly {leave seeds if you like it HOT}
1/4 cup chopped cilantro
1 avocado, peeled, seeded and thinly sliced
Recipe:
Place steak, lime juice and spices in a large bowl and toss together until steak is evenly coated.
Set aside.
Place a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat, I used cast-iron. Add coconut oil to the pan and when melted add steak.
Try to lay steak out so that it is in a single layer on the pan.
Let steak sear 3-4 minutes, flip and cook the other side of steak for an additional 3-4 minutes, you want the outside to be completely seared. Remove steak from pan and set aside on a plate.
Add onions, peppers, garlic and mushrooms to pan tossing to coat. There should be enough juice from the steak to toss and coat your veggies. If not add about 1/4 cup of your vegetable broth. Try to scrape any excess brown bits that are stuck to the bottom of the pan. Toss your veggies until they start to soften, about 5 minutes. Add green onion, jalapeño, vegetable broth, steak and any juices that collected on the plate.
Toss and cook for an additional 5-8 minutes.
Remove from heat, toss cilantro on top as well as sliced avocado and additional jalapeño slices if you like.
Serve with rice, fajitas or lettuce cups

Title:
Pesto Chicken Zoodles
Ingredients:
For the zoodles:
3-4 medium zucchini made into zoodles with either a julienne peeler or spiralizer
Sea Salt
For the pesto sauce:
3 cups packed basil leaves
4 garlic cloves
¼ cup walnuts or pine nuts
½ cup extra virgin olive oil
½ teaspoon sea salt
¼ teaspoon black pepper
For the remaining Ingredients:
1 tablespoon coconut oil (or grass-fed butter/ghee)
1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into bite sized pieces
½ bunch asparagus (about 12 stalks) cut into 1” pieces, tough ends removed
1/3 cup sun dried tomatoes
¼ cup pine nuts
Sea salt & pepper, to taste
Recipe:
First up, let’s get the moisture out of the zoodles! No one likes watery zucchini! It’s totally up to you, and what you want to do with your zoodles, but I typically prefer the salting method. This gets the moisture out, so that they don’t become a watery mess when heated with the sauce. To do this, place your zoodles on top of paper towels and salt them generously. Set aside for at least 20 minutes, while they release their moisture.
Let’s make the quick pesto! Add all of the pesto ingredients to food processor (or blender) and pulse until well combined. Set aside.
Heat the coconut oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once the oil has melted, add the chicken to the pan. Sauté until the chicken is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Add the asparagus to the pan and sauté for 2-3 minutes, or until the asparagus starts to soften.
While the asparagus is cooking, let’s get back to the zoodles! Gently squeeze the salted zoodles between dry paper towels, or a clean dishrag, to remove the excess moisture.
Turn down the heat of the pan to medium-low, and add the zoodles to the pan. Stir well. Once the zoodles are warm, turn the heat off and add the pesto sauce, sun dried tomatoes, and pine nuts to the pan and stir until combined. Serve up and slurp up!
