Frittatas
Ingredients:
1 lb sweet Italian pork sausage casings removed
1 tbsp coconut oil
Bunch of fresh spinach roughly chopped
2 tbsp chopped fresh basil
*pinch of crushed red pepper optional
8 whole eggs whisked
1/2 tsp onion powder
1/4 tsp salt
2 roma tomatoes or 3 smaller tomatoes, thinly sliced
fine grain sea salt and pepper to taste
more chopped fresh basil for garnish
Recipe:
Preheat your oven to 375 degrees. Heat the coconut oil over med-hi heat in a medium sized cast iron or other ovenproof skillet
Crumble the sausage in the pan and cook, breaking it up as it cooks so it browns evenly. *Add the crushed red pepper now if you wish for extra spice.
Once your sausage is toasty brown, add the spinach to the pan and give it a stir to soften and blend with the sausage, then remove from heat.
Sprinkle the sausage mixture with chopped fresh basil once off the heat.
In a large bowl, whisk your eggs well with onion powder and salt, then pour egg mixture over sausage mixture slowly to cover.
Top the egg/sausage mixture with sliced tomatoes and sprinkle with more sea salt and black pepper, to taste.
Bake in the preheated oven 20-25 minutes, or until the eggs are set and edges begin to turn golden brown. Garnish with more fresh chopped basil once the frittata has baked.
Let it sit to cool and set a bit, and then either serve or wrap and refrigerate/freeze for later use.
